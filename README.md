This class taught me the importance and the amount of testing required for debugging programs. The class also taught me best practices 
in object oriented programming. Our professor also required us to use git and github to commit often when completing asssignemnts. 
We would pull from a repository that was created for our assignments, commit small blocks of well tested code often and push to the repository.
